                  A crash cymbal is a type of cymbal that produces a loud, sharp
                  "crash" and is used mainly for occasional accents, as opposed
                  to a ride cymbal. It can be mounted on a stand and played with
                  a drum stick, or by hand in pairs. One or two crash cymbals
                  are a standard part of a drum kit. Suspended crash cymbals are
                  also used in bands and orchestras, either played with a
                  drumstick or rolled with a pair of mallets to produce a
                  slower, swelling crash. Sometimes a drummer may hit two
                  different crash cymbals in a kit at the same time to produce a
                  very loud accent, usually in rock music (Wikipedia, 2023a).

                  A floor tom or low tom is a double-headed tom-tom drum which
                  usually stands on the floor on three legs. However, they can

                  supported by a rim mount. It is a cylindrical drum without
                  snare wires, and tend to produce a booming, resonant sound
                  which can vary in pitch (Wikipedia, 2023b).

                  A hi-hat (hihat, high-hat, etc.) is a combination of two
                  cymbals and a pedal, all mounted on a metal stand. It is a

                  of music including rock, pop, jazz, and blues. Hi-hats consist
                  of a matching pair of small to medium-sized cymbals mounted on
                  a stand, with the two cymbals facing each other. The bottom
                  cymbal is fixed and the top is mounted on a rod which moves
                  the top cymbal toward the bottom one when the pedal is
                  depressed (a hi-hat that is in this position is said to be
                  "closed" or "closed hi-hats") (Wikipedia, 2022).

                  Also known as a “bass drum.” A kick drum is a large, low- or
                  indefinitely pitched drum that is played using one or more
                  mallets or beaters attached to foot-actuated pedal mechanisms.
                  Typically the drum is mounted vertically, and is the
                  lowest-pitched instrument in a drum kit. Kick drum widths
                  (diameters) range from 16 to 28 inches, with depths from 14 to
                  18 inches. In many cases, the kick drum also serves as a base
                  for tom-tom mounts. Typically, kit kick drums are heavily
                  muffled with blankets, pillows, or other materials in order to
                  control resonance and ringing (Sweetwater, 2010).

                  The ride cymbal is a cymbal of material sustain used to
                  maintain a beat in music. A standard in most drum kits, the
                  ride's function is to maintain a steady pattern," sometimes
                  called a ride pattern, rather than provide the accent of a
                  crash cymbal. It is normally placed on the extreme right (or
                  dominant hand) of a drum set, above the floor tom. It is often
                  described as delivering a "shimmering" sound when struck
                  soundly with a drumstick, and a clear ping when struct atop
                  its bell (Wikipedia, 2023c).

                  The snare (or side drum) is a percussion instrument that
                  produces a sharp staccato sound when the head is struck with a
                  drum stick, due to the use of a series of stiff wires held
                  under tension against the lower skin. Snare drums are often
                  used in orchestras, concert bands, marching bands, parades,
                  drumlines, drum corps, and more. It is one of the central
                  pieces in a drum set, a collection of percussion instruments
                  designed to be played by a seated drummer and used in many
                  genres of music (Wikipedia, 2020).

                  A tom drum (also known as a tom-tom) is a cylindrical drum
                  with no snares, named from the Anglo-Indian and Sinhala
                  language.[1] It was added to the drum kit in the early part of
                  the 20th century. Most toms range in size between 6 and 20
                  inches (15 and 51 cm) in diameter, though floor toms can go as
                  large as 24 inches (61 cm) (Wikipedia, 2023d).
